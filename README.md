**üèóÔ∏è Architecture**
The system follows a modular pipeline where each service has a single responsibility:
        Capture ‚Üí Parser ‚Üí Persistor ‚Üí PostgreSQL ‚Üê Analyzer ‚Üê UI
        
**Capture Service**

    ‚Ä¢	Sniffs live network packets (requires NET_ADMIN + NET_RAW capabilities)
    ‚Ä¢	Or replays packets from .pcap files
    ‚Ä¢	Sends packet metadata as JSON to the Parser Service

**Parser Service**

    ‚Ä¢	Classifies packets into TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, etc.
    ‚Ä¢	Normalizes data into a common JSON format
    ‚Ä¢	Forwards JSON to the Persistor Service

**Persistor Service** 

    ‚Ä¢	Inserts packet metadata into PostgreSQL
    ‚Ä¢	Maintains a packets table for analysis and queries

**Analyzer Service** 

    ‚Ä¢	Reads data from PostgreSQL
    ‚Ä¢	Exposes REST APIs for analysis:
    ‚Ä¢	/protocol_summary ‚Üí aggregated statistics by protocol
    ‚Ä¢	/packets ‚Üí list of packets
    ‚Ä¢	/filter ‚Üí filter packets by protocol, IP, etc.

**UI Service** 

    ‚Ä¢	React-based web dashboard
    ‚Ä¢	Calls Analyzer APIs to fetch data
    ‚Ä¢	Displays live charts, tables, and summaries in the browser
