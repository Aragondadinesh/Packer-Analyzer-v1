**🏗️ Architecture**
The system follows a modular pipeline where each service has a single responsibility:
        Capture → Parser → Persistor → PostgreSQL ← Analyzer ← UI
        
**Capture Service**

    •	Sniffs live network packets (requires NET_ADMIN + NET_RAW capabilities)
    •	Or replays packets from .pcap files
    •	Sends packet metadata as JSON to the Parser Service

**Parser Service**

    •	Classifies packets into TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, etc.
    •	Normalizes data into a common JSON format
    •	Forwards JSON to the Persistor Service

**Persistor Service** 

    •	Inserts packet metadata into PostgreSQL
    •	Maintains a packets table for analysis and queries

**Analyzer Service** 

    •	Reads data from PostgreSQL
    •	Exposes REST APIs for analysis:
    o	/protocol_summary → aggregated statistics by protocol
    o	/packets → list of packets
    o	/filter → filter packets by protocol, IP, etc.

**UI Service** 

    •	React-based web dashboard
    •	Calls Analyzer APIs to fetch data
    •	Displays live charts, tables, and summaries in the browser
